    <h2>Website Marketing</h2>
    <p> In October of 2017, I became an <strong>eCommerce Content Coordinator </strong> at rue21. In this role, I manage strategizing, planning, conception, and execution for all marketing pages on rue21.com. The marketing pages for the website include the homepage, category landing pages, FAQs, static landing pages, product listing page, and trend pages. I refresh all of the marketing content on the site periodically to align with in-store signage, to provide a consistant experience for omni-channel customers. When planning new content, I make sure that the highest volume driving product categories for girls, guys, plus, shoes, and accessories, that season, are presented on the site. To implement updates of all website content, I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript in Oracle's CMS platform, Endeca Workbench.</p>
    <p>In september of 2017, rue21 migrated from dedicated mobile site to a unified responsive site design in effort to improve customer experience(Foundation 6). We redesigned from using CMS, branding brand, for our mobile site to a responsive site in Oracles, Endeca Workbench.</p>
    <p>Since taking on this position, I have been able to influence site design through content reporting. Through analysis, I made the site more effiecent by decreasing the page load time and optimzing content placement. Some featutes I was able to implement were drop down menus for FAQ pages, update SEO copy throughout the site, making static pages take on a responsive design, creating carousel sliders for the homepage, added text overlay to the content, and updated the overall marketing design of the website.</p>

      <h3>Desktop</h3>
      <p>The desktop homepage displays our post holiday refresh. This <strong>40% off your purchase of $40 or more coupon</strong> was featured on the homepage as the top banner. To drive up conversion, the coupon was also features in a promo bar at the top of all pages and on the PDP's & PLP's (product description page & product listing page) under each product. The rue21 customer is a sale shopper so you are more likely to get customers to convert when there is some sort of promotion involved. The goal is to get the customer to convert with the woupon without sacrificing margin.</p>

   <h3>Secondary Banner</h3>
   <p>Marketing on the website depends on high volume product categories, seasonal trends, and product launches. Featured on the site is a perfume bottle for the recent launch of the "true" perfume. There is also an image of girl wearing a hoodies. Hoodies are the most searched product for this time of year. That is why it takes a position at the top of the site, just under the coupon.</p>

    <h3>Bottom Banner</h3>
    <p>It is important to include all of the different brands and categories you regulary speak to. This is why we incorporate a guys image in the homepage to show off jackets. I also try to accomidate for our plus customer by incorpating plus imagery as well. Each category has Call To Actions, CTAs, for girls, guys, and plus so all customers can be linked to their specific product. This is to create better customer experience.</p>

    <h3>Mobile</h3>
     <p>In September, rue21 trasitioned from an m.rue21.com mobile site to a responsive design. Since this restructure, I have to treat our entire site as 1, with a focus on mobile because nearly 70% of our online customers shop on a mobile device. To make sure the site can be responsive, I have to take into consideration how the desktop design will collapse down into the mobile site. That means images sizes, font sizes, and other factors need to be planned and tested.</p>

  <section id="email">
    <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
    <p>Throughout my internship with rue21 and leading into my first job as a <strong>Digital Marketing Coordinator</strong>, I executed the conception, production, and deployment of all targeted marketing emails for rue21. This including promotional, trend, store opening/closing, and other event emails. </p>
      <p>Photoshop is used to slice the email for future linking, then Dreamweaver is used to take the slices and peice the slices back together via HTML programming language. During this coding process, I create alt tags and strategically link the indivdual slices. Once the email is complete, I send the email file to Cheetah Digital, our email vendor, to add on the header, footer, and disclaimers. The email is then sent for back for testing. When testing, I make sure all images, links, tracking, alt tags, copy, and disclaimers are correct. After the email is approved, it is scheduled to send out to the full database or a segment of the database. </p>
  </section>
  <section class="email_info col-6">
     <div class="col-3">
       <h3>Email</h3>
      <p>With email, there is more freedom to speak to different products and events all in one place. When planning the design of email and other assets, we try to keep a consistent experience. Like planning for any marketing, you have to try to be as realvant as possible for that time period. This email is relevant becuase it was an end of winter email that speaks to new arrivals. At this end of Holiday, retailers tend to push clearance but we tried to beat out our competitors by speaking to whats fresh and new at rue21. We also had a coupon offer attached to drive customers to shop after Holiday has ended.

    <h2>SMS Marketing</h2>
    <p>As a Digital Marketing Coordinator, I designed, produced, scheduled, and deployed segmented SMS marketing campaigns. By sending SMS messages, we try to drive our omni-channel customers to shop at a near by store or hop online to shop. For SMS, I would work with Waterfalls platform to plan, test, and schedule <strong>SMS campaigns</strong>. We are contracted to send up to 8 SMS per mont. Some events we send SMS for would be clearance, promotional, coupon, and loyalty program events. The texts have to be within 160 characters so it is important to learn how to fit the neccessary information in without taking away from branded language.</p>
    <p>SMS gives you the option to be your own copy writer and be creative with your work in a limited amount of characters. How creative can you be in 160 characters?</p>

      <h3>SMS</h3>
    <p>The SMS message to the left is an example an end of winter blow out sale. The purpose of this sale was to sell out of our holiday clearance items so we can start fresh with a new assortment. For this event, we wanted to reach as many customers as possible so sending an SMS was a great way to reach our omni-channel customer. </p>
    <p>This SMS links the customers to rue21 find a store page so they can find where their closest store. For some coupon campaigns, I create a landing page on rue21.com/ This page consists of the deal, promo code, bar code, and redemption dates of the deal. This makes it easy for our customers to over the link in the SMS and apply it online or take it to a store to scan.</p>

      <h2>Channel Marketing</h2>
      <p>In both coordinator positions I have taken on at rue21, I have been in charge of <strong>display</strong> and other channel planning. For Display, I work with a vendor to "display" our branded and non-branded ads across the web. Sitelink copy is created to go with daily promotions and events as well. </p>
          <p>I coordinate with digital graphic designers on what categories or promotions need assets designed. There are 6 different spec sizes for these display assets (300x250, 300x50,320x50, 728x90, 160x600, 970x250). The smaller spec sizes for display (300x50 and 320x50) are to accomidate our mobile customer. Once the assets are design, I check to make sure there is a call to action, the promotion is correct, the copy is correct, and any other requests for the assets are fulfilled. We generally send around 2-3 display assets per week with our biggest promotions leading. We also create <strong>evergreen display assets</strong> to create brand awareness. These evergreen assets will live for a retail season and then be updated. </p>

          <h3>Display</h3>
          <p>The types of display assets we create are evergreen, trend, or promotional ads. Through reporting, I was able to make differences in our bland display ads we previously had. Our ads used to be text only and we had only 2 spec sizes. From analyzing reports, I was able to better our program by incorporating gif ads, ads with model/laydown imagery, adding more spec sizes (including mobile sizes), created evergreen strategy, and cut back on how many ads active per week. Through doing so, I was able to optimize our display ad performance.</p>
