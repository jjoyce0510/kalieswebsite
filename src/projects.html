    <h2>Website Marketing</h2>
    <p> In October of 2017, I became an <strong>eCommerce Content Coordinator </strong> at rue21. In this role, I manage strategizing, planning, conception, and execution for all marketing pages on rue21.com. The marketing pages for the website include the homepage, category landing pages, FAQs, static landing pages, product listing page, and trend pages. I refresh all of the marketing content on the site periodically to align with in-store signage, to provide a consistant experience for omni-channel customers. When planning new content, I make sure that the highest volume driving product categories for girls, guys, plus, shoes, and accessories, that season, are presented on the site. To implement updates of all website content, I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript in Oracle's CMS platform, Endeca Workbench.</p>
    <p>In september of 2017, rue21 migrated from dedicated mobile site to a unified responsive site design in effort to improve customer experience(Foundation 6). We redesigned from using CMS, branding brand, for our mobile site to a responsive site in Oracles, Endeca Workbench. Nearly 70% of our online customers shop on a mobile device so there is a focus on mobile design first.</p>
    <p>Since taking on this position, I have been able to influence site design through content reporting. Through analysis, I made the site more effiecent by decreasing the page load time and optimzing content placement. Some featutes I was able to implement were drop down menus for FAQ pages, update SEO copy throughout the site, making static pages take on a responsive design, creating carousel sliders for the homepage, added text overlay to the content, and updated the overall marketing design of the website.</p>

        <h3>Desktop Homepage</h3>
        <p>The desktop homepage, to the right, displays our post holiday refresh campaign. This <strong>40% off your purchase of $40+ coupon</strong> was featured on the homepage as the hero banner message. To drive conversion, the coupon was featured on a global banner across the top of all pages and on the PDP's & PLP's (product description page & product listing page) under each product. </p>

       <h3>Desktop Content</h3>
     <p>The strategy for this marketing campaign was to feature the highest volume driving categories, product trends, and product launches, that were realavant to the post holiday season. Featured on the site was a perfume bottle for the recent launch of the "true" perfume. There is also an image of a girl wearing a hoodie because sweatshirts and hoodies were a relevant product for this time of year.</p>

      <p>Incorporated on the site were images and call to actions for all categories (girls, guys, & plus). The homepage had a graphic asset of guys jackets &amp; and a graphic asset of girls denim to help show off the girls and guys categories. Each category had Call To Actions, CTAs, so all categories of customers can be linked to their specific product, to create better customer experience.</p>

      <h3>Mobile Homepage</h3>
       <p>In September, rue21 trasitioned from an m.rue21.com mobile site to a responsive design. To make sure the site can be responsive, I have to take into consideration how the desktop design will collapse down into the mobile site.</p>
       <p>The mobile site to the left featured the same <strong>40% off your purchase of $40+ coupon</strong> that desktop had. This banner was a gif that flipped through our brand colors for that time period. The strategy was to keep a consistent experience across the site and other channels.</p>

       <p>Jeans were a hot item during the post holiday season. They were featured on the homepage and category landing pages for more exposure.</p>

    <h2>Email Marketing</h2>
    <p>Throughout my internship with rue21 and leading into my first job as a <strong>Digital Marketing Coordinator</strong>, I executed the conception, production, and deployment of all targeted marketing emails for rue21. This including promotional, trend, store opening/closing, and other event emails. </p>
      <p>Photoshop is used to slice the email for future linking, then Dreamweaver is used to take the slices and peice the slices back together via HTML programming language. During this coding process, I create alt tags and strategically link the indivdual slices. Once the email is complete, I send the email file to Cheetah Digital, our email vendor, to add on the header, footer, and disclaimers. The email is then sent for back for testing. When testing, I make sure all images, links, tracking, alt tags, copy, and disclaimers are correct. After the email is approved, it is scheduled to send out to the full database or a segment of the database. </p>

        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>When planning the design of all digital marketing assets, including the creation of email, we try to provide customers with a consistent experience across all channels. The hero message of this email was our post holiday coupon, <strong>40% off your purchase of $40+</strong>. During post Holiday, retailers tend to push clearance but rue21 wanted to show our fresh apparel by messaging girls &amp; guys new arrivals.</p>
        <p>This email is a gif with the coupon slice flipping through our branded color pallet for post holiday. There are buttons under the coupon to lead you to find a store or to take you to the website to shop. The copy "fresh start" speaks to Holiday is over so its time to shop our new arrivals. There are Call to Actions under the girls and guys images linking to their new arrivals pages with fresh product for our customers to shop.</p>
        <p>To drive urgence and obtain any last minute sales, we send last day and final hours emails out for any coupon or event. These emails tend to drive the most revenue and highest click thru and open rates. We also send preview emails the day before a coupon to a segmented list of in store customers to give them time to plan to get to a store. These emails also perform well.</p>

    <h2>SMS Marketing</h2>
    <p>As a Digital Marketing Coordinator, I designed, produced, scheduled, and deployed segmented SMS marketing campaigns. By sending SMS messages, we try to drive our omni-channel customers to shop at a near by store or hop online to shop. For SMS, I would work with Waterfalls platform to plan, test, and schedule <strong>SMS campaigns</strong>. We are contracted to send up to 8 SMS per mont. Some events we send SMS for would be clearance, promotional, coupon, and loyalty program events. The texts have to be within 160 characters so it is important to learn how to fit the neccessary information in without taking away from branded language.</p>
    <p>SMS gives you the option to be your own copy writer and be creative with your work in a limited amount of characters. How creative can you be in 160 characters?</p>

        <h3>SMS</h3>
      <p>The SMS message to left is for the <strong> 40% off your purchase of $40+</strong> coupon. For this event, we wanted to reach as many customers as possible so sending an SMS was a great way to reach our omni-channel customer. </p>
      <p>This SMS links the customers to a marketing landing page on rue21.com. This page consists of the a graphic that displays the deal, a promo code, a bar code, disclaimer, and redemption dates for the coupon. This makes it easy for our customers to choose to either redeem the coupon online or take it to a store to be scanned.</p>

      <h2>Channel Marketing</h2>
      <p>In both coordinator positions I have taken on at rue21, I have been in charge of <strong>display</strong> and other channel planning. For Display, I work with a vendor to "display" our branded and non-branded ads across the web. Sitelink copy is created to go with daily promotions and events as well. </p>
          <p>I coordinate with digital graphic designers on what categories or promotions need assets designed. There are 6 different spec sizes for these display assets (300x250, 300x50,320x50, 728x90, 160x600, 970x250). The smaller spec sizes for display (300x50 and 320x50) are to accomidate our mobile customer. Once the assets are design, I check to make sure there is a call to action, the promotion is correct, the copy is correct, and any other requests for the assets are fulfilled. We generally send around 2-3 display assets per week with our biggest promotions leading. We also create <strong>evergreen display assets</strong> to create brand awareness. These evergreen assets will live for a retail season and then be updated. </p>

          <h3>Display</h3>
          <p>The types of display assets we create are evergreen, trend, or promotional ads. Through reporting, I was able to make differences in our bland display ads we previously had. Our ads used to be text only and we had only 2 spec sizes. From analyzing reports, I was able to better our program by incorporating gif ads, ads with model/laydown imagery, adding more spec sizes (including mobile sizes), created evergreen strategy, and cut back on how many ads active per week. Through doing so, I was able to optimize our display ad performance.</p>
