    <h1> ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p> Hello, my name is <strong>Kalie Soller</strong> and I am a <strong>Digital Marketing Professional</strong>. I currently work at the fast-fashion retailer, <strong>rue21</strong>, as an eCommerce Content Coordinator. In my career at rue21, I implement updates to all marketing pages on rue21.com via HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript. I also have experience in SEO, Email, SMS, Digital Center Ads, and Display Marketing from my prior experiences with the company.</p>
      <p> The path to my career started when I went to college at <strong> Slippery Rock University</strong>, a small school outside of Pittburgh, PA. When I arrived at SRU as a freshman, I planned on majoring in Elementary Education. Before classes began, I had a change in heart and declared a Major to Marketing. After taking a year of marketing classes, I decided I wanted a focus in <strong>Digital Marketing</strong> so I added on a Minor in <strong>Information Systems</strong> to get a digital background in marketing.</p>
      <p>When I am not working on rue21.com, you can find me on the slopes, snowboarding with friends and family. The mountains are where I like to get away and take on the outdoors. When the seasons change, I spend my time laying out by the pool and soaking up the sun. I also enjoy playing sports like basketball, lacrosse, and tennis in the summer weather. Living in Pittsburgh, i've learned to enjoy the different activities that come with the change in seasons. Lastly, I also love visiting Notre Dame to watch some good ole Irish football. </p>
